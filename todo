1. Style
Note: I think we should do this first, as reorganization should probably be done before other work
  a. Move the JS out of the .html files
  b. Reorganize the JS so the file names make a bit more sense, and are a bit more unified
  c. Comment stuff. A big part of this project, at least for me, is to use as an example of my work, and good comments help with that.
2. Bugs
  a. The system has problems with differing time zones. The JS should switch all times to UTC or something.
  b. The server does not validate incoming data, making it easy to inject stuff.
3. Features
  a. First Round Addition
    i. Allow people to have better control over what time/location they want to show up
    ii. Implement Tagging
    iii. Better CSS for mobile. (I'm on mobile now. The site is barely usable. This is critical.)
  b. Second Round Addition
    i. Apps for the various mobile app stores
    ii. Extend 'foodfinder' to 'event finder' (Maybe?)
4. Advertising / populating the DB?
  a. ff is only useful if lots of people use it: get people using it.
  b. Figure out a way to scrape FB or some other site for events?
